Project Overview: Interactive Visualization and Data Cleaning
 In order to improve data analysis and visualization, this project entailed organizing an unstructured and disorganized dataset into a labeled, interactive, and well-organized format.

 Important Steps:

 âœ” Data Labeling: To provide meaningful organization, raw text data was manually classified and labeled.

 âœ” Data Cleaning: To improve accuracy, redundant, inconsistent, and unnecessary information was eliminated.

 âœ” Graph & Visualization: To improve insights, the revised dataset was transformed into an interactive graphical format.

 This project demonstrates the effectiveness of data preprocessing in transforming unprocessed data into visually informative and useable information! ðŸš€
